Machine learning models to predict credit default risk using Python

# Credit Risk Machine Learning Model

## Overview
This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict credit default risk using borrower demographic and financial data.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Model evaluation using ROC-AUC and confusion matrix

## Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Results
Random Forest achieved the strongest overall performance and provided improved recall on defaulted loans.

## How to Run
Open the notebook and run all cells sequentially.

## Data

This project uses the Credit Card Approval dataset from Kaggle:

Files used:
- application_record.csv
- credit_record.csv

Due to file size limits, raw datasets are not included in this repository.
